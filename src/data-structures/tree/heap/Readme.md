- A heap is a complete binary-tree.

#### Max Heap

- A max-heap is a binary tree where the descendants of any node are less than the node itself.
- Here, the largest value would be the root of the tree.

#### Min Heap

- A min-heap is a binary tree where the descendants of any node are greater than the node itself.
- Here, the smallest value would be the root of the tree.
