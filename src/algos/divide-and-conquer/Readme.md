### Divide & Conquer

- These are the problems which can be solved by dividing the larger problem into smaller sub-problems.
- Each sub-problem should be similar to the larger problem, i.e. each subproblem should be aimed at solving the same problem.

#### Inclusions

- Base case involves handling of the smallest sub-problem which can be easily handled.
- There should be a way of dividing a problem into sub-problems, as well as combining the results of the sub-problem into a solution.
- These problems usually involve a recursive solution, i.e. breaking into sub-problems till they cannot be broken down any further.
